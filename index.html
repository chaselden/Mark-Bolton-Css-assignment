                Hello.
             </h4>
             <div class="article-body">
                  <p>
                   Mark Bolton Design was a small design studio. In
                   2014, <span>we were aquired by Monotype.</span>
                  </P>
                 <p>
                   Over the years, we <span>built an amazing team</span> and worked
                   on some <span>tremendous projects with the smartest
                   clients</span>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful
                   for. But, It's time for a change.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   The move to monotype brings us closer to the
                   problems we want to fix. Mark Bolton Design is now
                   closed. The team will be working on Monotype
                   projects from the same premises in th UK and we'll
                   still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at web
                   conferences.We're not going anywhere.
